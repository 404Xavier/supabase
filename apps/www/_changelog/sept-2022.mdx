## Improvements

- We’re migrating projects to new infra to support upcoming Multiplayer features. Check out [multiplayer.dev](http://multiplayer.dev) and submit your info to be the first to know when these features drop.
- Gotrue now bubbles up postgres errors if the underlying error is from a RaiseException or if they were Integrity Constraint Violations. [Link](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/pull/404)
- Added `auth.jwt()` function to return the user's jwt claims and we’ll be deprecating `auth.email(), auth.uid(), auth.role()` in a few months. [PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/pull/484)
- Supabase Auth now provides IP addresses in the Audit Log.
- Random password generator when creating projects.
